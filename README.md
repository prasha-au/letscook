# Let's Cook

This project aims to parse websites for recipes and present them in a user friendly way.


## Why?
I found quite often when cooking that recipe websites...
 - did not make full use of the screen space
 - required excessive scrolling between ingredients and steps
 - all had different layouts
 - had excessive ads
 - were not always available


## Supported sites
It should be fairly easy to add new websites.
 - Most sites using [Wordpress Recipe Maker](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-recipe-maker/)
 - taste.com.au
